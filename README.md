# airbnb-analytics-data-warehouse
End-to-end data warehouse and analytics pipeline for Airbnb listings, pricing, and availability using BigQuery and Looker Studio.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow using modern analytics tools. Starting from a raw Airbnb CSV dataset, I designed and implemented a star-schema data model, performed data cleaning and transformations using Python (Pandas), loaded the processed data into Google BigQuery, and built interactive dashboards in Looker Studio for business insights.

The goal of this project was to simulate how a data engineer / analytics engineer would structure, transform, and expose data for analytics and visualization in a production-like environment.
